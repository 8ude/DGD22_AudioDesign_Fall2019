WEEK 1 ASSIGNMENTS

Reading - [Seeing Circles Signs & Signals: “Intro, Signals & Sound” & “Sines & Sampling”](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/); please finish reading by Thursday, September 13

Critical Listening - working with a partner, play a game from the provided list, [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bn5J00GZ341uofRyMuntdbZQDFrSYf6LfDXIevePOCA/edit?usp=sharing), or make a case for a different game (do NOT watch a Let’s Play).  How would you describe the overall audio aesthetic, mood, or feeling of the game?  What do you think are the most important sounds, and why?  How do sounds change in response to player action (some sounds may be randomized, or connected to in-game physics in interesting ways)?  Look up some facts about the creation of the game audio - what’s interesting about the techniques or technology used?

You will be presenting a brief (~7 minute) presentation during a lab time, at some point in the semester.  Schedule a week using the above list.  I'd prefer to only have one presentation per week.  They can be as early as Week 2 (September 12) if you want to get it out of the way.  It's a pass-fail assignment, and shouldn't take very long to complete.

For next class, bring in 3 sounds from a game project that you’ve worked on.  If you haven't worked on a game project, find a few short (20 seconds or less) sounds on Freesound.org
