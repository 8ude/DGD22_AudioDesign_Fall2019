See the [Wiki](https://github.com/8ude/DGD22_AudioDesign_Fall2019/wiki) for Helpful Links and slides from past weeks

You can find the [Syllabus here](https://github.com/8ude/DGD22_AudioDesign_Fall2019/blob/master/2019_Fall_CoreyBertelsen_AudioDesignForGamesDGD22%20001.pdf)

WEEK 3 ASSIGNMENT
------

[Choose 3 animated gifs from this directory](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1e_qmV88zN6YjvZpqyoVz3NtHGxD1qU3e).  If you want, you can find or make your own, provided that they are roughly 10 seconds long and contain a significant amount of motion.

Add sound effects to accompany the gifs.  The goal for the first pass is to have a distinct sound for every distinct motion - try to make it believable, as if the motions in the gif are producing the sound. 

Then, do a "second pass" on the same 3 gifs.  Choose different source material, and take a different artistic direction.  Try to still have sound for almost every motion. 

Render these (there should be 6 total) as WEBM videos and [upload them here when you're done](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qxrEmKnZQF3m_l4I2pQ5KADMj9tTX0I5).  Make a sub-folder with your name.   

WEEK 2 ASSIGNMENT
------
Sound Collage - Create a 3-5 minute “story” (whatever that means to you) using samples sourced from Freesound.org (or elsewhere).  Experiment with different sample rates, bit depths, and sculpting using filters and EQ.

[Here's a quick tutorial on Rendering Reaper files](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u33zeQcDhvRbJRrL2OdQ2vjyfth48lWYiCvT-erEX1c/edit?usp=sharing) 

Post your sound files [HERE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HrcL6GNCJ9EXvec5hhoKvY6lRSxjHI8s) when you are done.

WEEK 1 ASSIGNMENTS
------

Reading - [Seeing Circles Signs & Signals: “Intro, Signals & Sound” & “Sines & Sampling”](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/); please finish reading by Thursday, September 13

Critical Listening - working with a partner, play a game from the provided list, [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bn5J00GZ341uofRyMuntdbZQDFrSYf6LfDXIevePOCA/edit?usp=sharing), or make a case for a different game (do NOT watch a Let’s Play).  How would you describe the overall audio aesthetic, mood, or feeling of the game?  What do you think are the most important sounds, and why?  How do sounds change in response to player action (some sounds may be randomized, or connected to in-game physics in interesting ways)?  Look up some facts about the creation of the game audio - what’s interesting about the techniques or technology used?

You will be presenting a brief (~7 minute) presentation, at some point in the semester.  Schedule a week using the above list.  I'd prefer to only have one presentation per week.  They can be as early as Week 2 (September 12) if you want to get it out of the way.  It's a pass-fail assignment, and shouldn't take very long to complete.

For next class, bring in 3 sounds from a game project that you’ve worked on.  If you haven't worked on a game project, find a few short (20 seconds or less) sounds on Freesound.org
